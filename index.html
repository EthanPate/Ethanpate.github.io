				<p>Hi, Ethan Pate! My Hobbies include discovery about our world, like the types of fish I see when I go diving, or when I walk through the woods. I enjoy tyring to learn new things like the meaning behind the zodic signs and if I can use them to help people understand why they feel a certain way. Im also trying teach myself about herbs or plants that can be used to help with sickness, body pains, burns, or cuts to the body. This is known as Herbalism and agian im try to re-learn the study of Insects and Spiders. Most people fear them, but without them humans would die this eath would die, we need them as much as much as they need us. Also for those of you who find yourselfs down or lost, go to the forset find a tree amd sit under it then closes your eyes and listen.  </p>
